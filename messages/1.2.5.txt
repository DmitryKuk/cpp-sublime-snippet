     Change-log
====================

Thanks for downloading this package!

Changes from v1.2.0 to v1.2.5 include:

- Preprocessor snippets end with a newline.
- New snippet: `beginend_` which expands to `std::begin($1), std::end($1)`.
- Removal of the source.c++11 scope
- New category of snippets: traits
    - Implements different ways of making type traits
    - To avoid conflict with regular code, these will have the cpptrait prefix
    - Currently, only one is provided: cpptraitfun to create a type trait
      based on trait inheritance.

Documentation could be found through the usual manner:
Preferences > Package Settings > C++ Snippets
