Thanks for downloading this package!

Changes from v1.2.0 to v1.2.5 include:

- Preprocessor snippets end with a newline.
- New snippet: `beginend_` which expands to `std::begin($1), std::end($1)`.

As always, if you would like to add a snippet feel free to send me a pull
request on GitHub: https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet
