# C++ Snippets for Sublime Text

---
**NOTE:**
- This repository is fork of this: [https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet](https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet) by [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz).
- *Why?* I want to use snippets according to my code style and my needs.
- **What are the differences?**
    + *In snippets:* Code style changed, some unuseful (in my opininion) snippets removed, some improved. Use `diff`, Luke. ;)
    + *In docs and installation:* Sublime's package manager can't install this. You should install it manually. This README.md file corrected. File reference.md is not corrected yet (do it later)!
- *What's next?* Maybe, I will fill up this collection. I don't know.

This package adds some useful snippets for Sublime Text for C++11. It matches the following style:

```cpp

    /* code */
}
```
